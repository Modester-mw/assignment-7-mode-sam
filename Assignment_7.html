<h1>Assignment 7 Instructions</h1>

Congratulations on all the work that you have done so far :) <br>
In assignment 7 , we are testing our skills regarding recursions and we are developing our projects.<br>
Remember , if there is anything here that you don't quite understand , please ask me :) <br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
This question comes with a video , I encourage you to see the video of how the game is played <br>
for as many times as you need until you understand well how it is played before writing the code.<br><br>

Write a java program that plays the Tower of Hanoi game<br>
There are three poles and 5 discs of different sizes. <br>
Initially, all the discs are placed on the first pole, with the largest disc at the bottom and
the smallest one at the top. <br>
We need to move all the discs from the first pole to the third pole, with the smallest disc at the top and
the largest at the bottom. <br>
We can move only one disc at a time (which should be the topmost disc), and at any point of time,
a larger disc cannot be placed over a smaller one <br>i.e. all the discs on a pole must be placed
in such a way that the smallest is at the top and the largest at the bottom.<br>
The second pole can be used as an intermediate pole to help us in transferring the discs.<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 30 marks <br>
Using recursion is worth 10 marks<br>
If the recursion runs well and does not run forever, that is worth 10 marks<br>
You need to print the first collection, the one you start with and the last collection,
the one you end up with, and that is worth 3 marks <br>
Putting the author on the top on the file that is worth 3 marks.<br>
Explaining your algorithm is worth 5 marks<br>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
Write the full code of your project so far. Not the test cases.<br>
This question is worth 70 marks <br>
Having all the classes from your design coded, 40 marks <br>
Having the names of the authors on the top of every file 10 marks <br>
Proper commenting which is on the top of every method:- <br>
you need to put a comment about what that method does and on top of every class you need to put a comment of
what that class represent, 20 marks <br>

<h3>Have fun :)</h3>
